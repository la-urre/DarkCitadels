# DarkCitadels

This is an infamous implementation of the [Citadels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citadels_(card_game)) board game.

It comes from [this cleaner version](https://github.com/la-urre/Citadels) and has been highly degraded for educational purposes at _Institut Universitaire de Technologie_ of Bayonne (France).

This repo is archived as I don't plan to add any modification. I won't delete it for past students to keep a trace of it.
